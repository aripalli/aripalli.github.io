Assignment 2A: One scatter plot and two datasets

Explain in your own words why you think I want the axes to be the same for both years? 
(Even though you know how to make axes adapt to the data values.)

If the axes change after the transisition it can be really hard to compare the change.
The main idea with the plot is to show how the crime has changed over the years.
If the axis changes then this whole point might just vanish.


Assignment 2B: Visualizing geodata

Think carefully about how you can minimize the size of the file containing the data. 
My file is around 700KB. Why is the size of the file important?

The file is loaded into the website. It is therefore important that it is not too large.
Large files take longer time to load and would make the website laggy and slow.
